The sun is the closest star to Earth and the center of our solar system. It is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, undergoing nuclear fusion to produce energy, which radiates as heat and light. This energy is essential for life on Earth, driving weather patterns and enabling photosynthesis in plants. The sun is about 4.6 billion years old and is expected to continue burning for another 5 billion years before it evolves into a red giant and eventually a white dwarf.
